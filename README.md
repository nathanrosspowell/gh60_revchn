Custom firmware for the GH60 'Satan' edition

# How to guide

I followed the [guide][gist] layed out by @tofagerl. The current version (at time of writing) is backed up in this repo for safety.

Small difference is that I grabbed `gh60` folder from trom the root tmk folder as it had the `KEYMAP` macro with split backspace support.
